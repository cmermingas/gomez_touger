## Domestic Abuse Charges And Restraining Order Violations

Domestic violence can happen between spouses, between family members, or between people in a relationship who lived together at one time and/or have children together. In Florida, people may file an injunction for protection against domestic violence after only one incident. If the accused violates the order, he or she can be arrested.

If a restraining order is taken out against you and you agree to it, you are agreeing to the restraining order being on your permanent record. This will affect your future job opportunities and your right to possess firearms. It is better to speak with a lawyer first so we can advise you of your rights and take action to protect them.

When a couple is in a contentious divorce or child custody battle, one person may make false domestic violence accusations to try to influence the family law judge. If you have been falsely accused, we will work to resolve the issue and clear your name.
