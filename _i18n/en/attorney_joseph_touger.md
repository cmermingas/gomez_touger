When you are accused of a crime, you will be up against a team of prosecutors who will use the latest in investigative technology, as well as a justice system stacked against you, to accomplish its goal of turning you into a convicted criminal- regardless of innocence or guilt.

At such a critical time, you will need a seasoned criminal defense attorney in your corner to fight against such a powerful force. With nearly two decades of experience, attorney Joseph M. Touger will protect you and your rights in both state and federal courts. Mr. Touger is a former state prosecutor who has handled serious cases ranging from first degree murder to capital sexual battery. As a graduate of Florida’s Life Over Death program, Mr. Touger is also licensed and qualified to defend death penalty cases at both the trial and appellate levels.

Prior to leaving the State Attorney’s office, Mr. Touger was a member of the specialized team of prosecutors assigned to handle child sex crimes. He is a graduate of the National Symposium on Child Sexual Abuse and received intensive training in handling the intricacies of a wide array of sex offenses including, but not limited to, internet crimes, lewd molestation, and possession of child pornography. This training and experience has given Mr. Touger a valuable advantage in defending individuals facing these very serious charges. Mr. Touger also understands that many innocent people are accused of these crimes as a result of bitter child custody battles, police entrapment, and adult manipulation of a child’s testimony. With this perspective, Mr. Touger is able to craft a defense designed to expose the falsities in the prosecution’s case and secure an acquittal for his clients.

Thankfully, most people will never find themselves facing a serious criminal charge. So while Mr. Touger is highly qualified to handle the most serious of cases, he also dedicates a large portion of his practice to defending first-time offenders charged with minor crimes. Drug possession, DUI, suspended license, and theft cases are as vigorously defended as the major crimes, yet with a personal touch designed to help the inexperienced client bear the stressful burden of a criminal accusation. It is no coincidence that a significant number of Mr. Touger’s clients are students whose parents have hired Mr. Touger to protect their children’s rights and help them preserve their futures by expunging their records once their cases are concluded.

As an experienced criminal defense lawyer, Mr. Touger is all too aware that the trial courts often convict people of crimes they did not commit. This can result from deceptive witnesses, overzealous prosecutors, inexperienced judges, or a combination of the above. It is also why preserving a client’s appellate rights is just as important as a vigorous investigation and an aggressive defense. Mr. Touger has successfully argued appellate cases in state and federal courts and has represented clients in all facets of post-conviction litigation.

Mr. Touger also recognizes that professional associations and community networking are an integral part of the legal profession. Mr. Touger is a member of the national, Florida, and Hillsborough County Associations of Criminal Defense Lawyers and has appeared as a guest legal analyst on Court TV, Bay News 9, and Bay News 9 en Espanol. He is also a proud member of the University of Florida Foundation Hillsborough Regional Council, Florida Justice Association, Tampa Bay Trial Lawyers Association and the West Tampa Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Touger has also contributed countless hours of free (pro bono) legal work to disadvantaged families and community organizations.

In conclusion, Mr. Touger and the legal team of Gomez & Touger, P.A. are committed to providing you with experienced and aggressive representation in any of Florida’s state and federal courts. If you are charged with any type of crime, please let our team of attorneys, paralegals, legal assistants, and investigators work to protect your innocence, your rights, and, most importantly, your future.
