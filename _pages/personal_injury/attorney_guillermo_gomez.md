When you are hurt due to the negligence of others, it is both upsetting and frightening.  You may feel that the situation is hopeless and that you can’t fight the big insurance companies on your own. Regardless of your problem, my job is to fix it by providing a course of action to maximize your recovery from the at-fault parties or their insurance companies

My first goal is to obtain the best results for my clients. I accomplish this by being aggressive, harder working, and smarter than the insurance companies and their lawyers. Since graduating from Georgetown University Law School over 20 years ago, I have dedicated my legal career to being the best advocate for my clients in the Tampa Bay area.

I have been a trial lawyer for nearly all of my professional career spanning more than 20 years. I understand how the other side works and thinks. My firm and I have handled thousands of injury cases including wrongful death, traumatic brain injury, and total disability cases. I am licensed to appear in all Florida state and federal courts and have argued appeals and petitioned cases as far the U.S. Supreme Court.
 
I will do everything legally possible to exploit any weaknesses in the insurance company’s case to help you prevail.  This is accomplished by an aggressive investigation. I have at my disposal  a seasoned team of paralegals, case managers, and an in-house investigator who are committed to an in-depth investigation into my personal injury cases. Additionally, I work closely with our clients’ health care providers to best understand our clients’ injuries. Many times, through the hard work that comes from an aggressive investigation, I am able to have my clients’ cases settle for the total available policy limits.

However, if we are required to go to trial, this intelligent and aggressive investigation puts us in the best position possible to prevail and secure a fair financial award. There is no case too small or too complex that I do not enjoy litigating. Thus, while you may come into my office scared and upset and feeling that your problem is insurmountable, my goal is to ensure that when you walk out of my office, you have both hope and a strong belief that I will make the legal system work for you.
