# Personal Injury Lawyers
 
At {{ site.data.business.name }}, we understand that when you are hurt due to someone else’s negligence, your entire life and those of your family members are greatly impacted. Whether it is a car crash, a work-place injury, or a fall at a commercial location, your physical and financial future will be affected by the outcome. Working with an experienced attorney is crucial to protecting your rights.

## Work Directly With Experienced Trial Lawyers

Our background as state prosecutors and civil trial attorneys for more than 20 years and through thousands of cases gives us unique insight into the Florida court system. We know what it takes to present a convincing case to a jury and a judge who will decide you and your family’s fate. Our experience allows us to carefully investigate the case, examine all the evidence, and present your side of the story in a compelling and heartfelt manner. 

Thorough case preparation is critical to any personal injury representation. We have a team of paralegals, case managers, and an in-house investigator who are committed to an in-depth investigation into all our personal injury cases. Additionally, we work closely with our clients’ health care providers to best understand our clients’ injuries and how their health has been severely impacted. We also work with experts in areas such as forensics, accident reconstruction, economics, and life-care planning to put forth the best possible case to the insurance companies and the courts. 

We also understand that not every client is comfortable going to trial.
