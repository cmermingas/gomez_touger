When you are hurt due to the negligence of others, you will be up against a team of insurance company professionals who will use the latest in investigative technology- as well as a justice system stacked against you- to accomplish their goal of compensating you less than you deserve- regardless of how badly you and your family are suffering.
 
At such a critical time, you will need a seasoned attorney in your corner to fight against such a powerful force. With more than two decades of experience, attorney Joseph M. Touger will protect you and your rights in both state and federal courts.
