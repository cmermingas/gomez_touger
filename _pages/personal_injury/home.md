## Important Do's If You Are Involved In A Crash

3. Take pictures of the crash scene and damage to all vehicles involved.
4. Exchange insurance information with the other driver.

   important medical and lost wage benefits.

## How Our Attorneys Can Help You

Insurance companies may not always be looking out for your best interests. An attorney can help navigate the challenges
of dealing with an insurer and maximize your recovery

1. Secure your full medical and lost wage benefits. Florida law requires your insurance carrier to provide up to
   $10,000 in medical bill and lost wage compensation. Our attorneys can help make sure your insurance carrier complies
   with Florida law and awards you all your benefits.

2. Secure a financial recovery for your injuries from the at-fault insurance company. If you are injured in a car crash,
   you have the right to seek monetary damages from the driver who caused the crash. Our attorneys can assist you in
   bringing a claim from the very beginning of a case and make sure that your case is properly valued.

3. Repairing or totaling out your damaged car. Depending on the policies available, either the at-fault driver or your
   own insurance company is responsible for fixing or paying out the total loss of your car. Many law firms, including
   some of the biggest you may see on TV, DO NOT assist their clients in this effort and leave them to fend for
   themselves. The attorneys at {{ site.data.business.name }} are happy to assist you with your property damage claim
   **AT NO EXTRA CHARGE**. We provide this service as a courtesy to our clients for trusting us to help them with
   their injury claim.

4. 24 Hour Service. Our firm prides itself on our personal assistance to our clients, regardless of day or night. Our
   number {{ site.data.business.locations.tampa.phone }} is answered by a live person 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We do not
   use answering machines or those annoying call center menus.

## We Guarantee Our Results And We Require No Upfront Fee From Our Clients 

Our law firm is paid only if we recover money for our clients. That means our clients do not need to pay any money
up-front for our services. And since we are paid based on a percentage of what our clients recover, we have incentive
to maximize the amount of recovery. In other words, the more our clients are paid, the more we are paid. 

## We Provide a Free Initial Consultation With An Attorney - Not A Secretary, Paralegal, Or Investigator

While our team is comprised of various legal specialists, we pride ourselves on having an attorney available to meet in
person with our prospective clients to discuss their injury case. There is no charge for this consultation and our
attorneys will be happy to answer to any questions or review any documentation that you provide.
