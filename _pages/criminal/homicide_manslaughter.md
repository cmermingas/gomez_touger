## We Challenge The Prosecution's Case

Investigation and examination of evidence is crucial in homicide and manslaughter cases. When appropriate to the case, we work with investigators and experts in areas such as forensics, DNA, accident reconstruction, medical examination and ballistics. In some cases, our investigation reveals that police procedure was not followed and that the evidence is not admissible.

We can defend you against charges such as:

* Murder

* Manslaughter

* DUI/vehicular manslaughter or homicide

* Negligent homicide

If the case against you is strong, we will discuss whether accepting a plea or going to trial is the right option. We will carefully explain the risks and benefits of each option so you can make an informed decision. You can rely on us to fight for lower sentences and penalties. We are skilled trial lawyers who know how to present violent crime cases to judges and juries.
