## Representation At Bond Hearings

In Florida, defendants typically have a right to bail/bond unless they are charged with a capital crime or a [probation violation]({% tl criminal.probation_violation %}). The prosecutor will give his or her bond recommendation at the hearing. The judge decides whether to grant bond and in what amount.

We represent people at their first court appearance and try to get bond for them. At this time, we will present evidence that the defendant is not likely to leave the jurisdiction. Showing evidence of a job, community ties and past criminal history, when relevant, may convince a judge to grant bond. If the bond amount is too high for you or your family to afford, we can file a motion to reduce bail.

The state will be represented by the prosecution at every hearing, so it is important that defendants also have representation. You have a right to legal counsel. Do not make the mistake of trying to represent yourself.
