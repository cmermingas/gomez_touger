# Tampa Expungements Lawyers

Your criminal record can include all arrests and criminal charges, regardless of whether you were convicted or plead guilty. Having a criminal record can affect your ability to get housing, jobs, government benefits, loans and permits for firearms. Depending on the offense, a record may also prevent you from enlisting in the military.

In some cases, you can have your criminal record sealed or expunged. Sealing a record makes it unavailable to the general public. Expunging a record makes it unavailable to other entities. Expungements can be complex, so you may want to work with a lawyer.

## Expunging A Record In Florida

Expungements are typically granted in cases involving dismissals, arrests that did not result in formal charges or the completion of pretrial substance abuse diversion programs. Nonviolent crimes with no victims are more likely to be eligible for expungement.

In general, you are not eligible for an expungement if you have already been granted one, you have a previous misdemeanor or felony conviction, or you are currently facing criminal charges. Many violent crimes, including sexual battery, robbery, stalking, aggravated assault and child abuse, cannot be expunged from a criminal record.

There are numerous exceptions and conditions involved in the expungement process. It is best to discuss your case with a lawyer before spending time and money seeking an expungement.
