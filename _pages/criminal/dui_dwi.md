## Defense Against Multiple Drunk Driving Charges

As former prosecutors, we know both sides of Florida DUI law. We know how police officers should conduct field sobriety tests and Breathalyzer tests. We know when you should be advised of your rights. You can rely on us to thoroughly investigate the police procedure and test results as part of our defense strategy.

A **first DUI conviction** has penalties that include a fine between $500 and $1,000, up to six months in jail, and a license revocation between 180 days and one year. Subsequent DUI convictions will impose much harsher penalties.

### Second DUI conviction within five years:

* Mandatory 10 days in jail; possibility of up to nine months in jail

* Fine between $1,000 and $2,000

* License revocation of at least five years; must serve one year before hardship license eligibility

* Ignition interlock device for at least one year

### Third DUI conviction within 10 years of the first DUI:

* May be charged as a felony

* Fine between $2,000 and $5,000

* Mandatory jail sentence of at least 30 days

* Minimum 10-year license revocation; must serve two years before hardship license eligibility

* Ignition interlock device for at least two years

A **fourth or subsequent DUI** will be charged as a felony. You do not want a felony conviction on your record. With our experience and familiarity with prosecutors, we can provide an aggressive, strategic defense.
