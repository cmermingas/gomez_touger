When you are arrested or charged with a crime, it is both upsetting and frightening.  You may feel that the situation is hopeless or how could the police make such a grievous mistake. Regardless of your problem, my job is to fix it.  I don’t just identify what is wrong in your case, I provide you with a course of action of how to combat your criminal matter.

My first goal is to obtain the best results for my clients. I accomplish this by being aggressive, harder working, and smarter than the prosecution. You may have heard that a person charged with a crime is presumed innocent.  Those are not just mere words for me.  It is that presumption of innocence that animates my representation of my clients. Since graduating from a top tier law school over 20 years ago, I have dedicated my legal career to being the best criminal defense attorney in the Tampa Bay area.

As a former prosecutor, I understand how the other side works and thinks. I have handled thousands of cases including first degree murder cases, death penalty cases and high profile media cases.  In addition, I have argued appeals and petitioned cases to the U.S. Supreme Court and have argued before the Florida State Courts and Florida District Court of Appeals.  Moreover, my membership in the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and Hillsborough County Bar Association provide me with access to a wide range of resources.

I will do everything legally possible to exploit any weaknesses in the State’s case to help you prevail.  This is accomplished by an aggressive investigation.  In Florida, a defendant can take the pre-trial discovery depositions of witnesses and my depositions are both detailed and thorough.   I use these pre-trial tools to tear down the State’s case against you. Many times, through the hard work that comes from an aggressive pre-trial investigation, I am able to have my client’s charges dismissed prior to trial.

If you are required to go to trial, this intelligent and aggressive pre-trial investigation puts you in the best position possible to prevail at a jury trial.  There is no case too small or too complex that I do not enjoy litigating. Thus, while you may come into my office scared and upset and feeling that your problem is insurmountable, my goal is to ensure that when you walk out of my office, you have both hope and a strong belief that I will make the legal system work for you.
