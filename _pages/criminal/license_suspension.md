## Restoring Your Florida Driver's License

We will represent you at the administrative license suspension hearing with the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV). You have only 10 days from the DUI arrest to request this hearing to protect your driving privileges. If you miss this deadline, you may lose your opportunity to get your license back.

It is best to have a lawyer represent you. We will ensure that the correct information is presented and that your rights are protected. Our trial experience is valuable in administrative hearings as well as in the courtroom.

DUI license suspensions and revocations have serious consequences, including:

* A first DUI conviction has a license revocation between 180 days and one year.

* A second DUI conviction within five years will result in a license revocation of at least five years. You must serve one year before hardship license eligibility applies.

* A third DUI conviction within 10 years of the first DUI will result in a minimum 10-year license revocation. You must serve two years before hardship license eligibility applies.

In addition to the suspension or revocation, you will have to pay administrative license renewal fees that may total more than $200. You may also have to take the written license exam again.
