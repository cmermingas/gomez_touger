## Auto Insurance Fraud, Health Insurance Fraud And Additional Charges

Insurance fraud is a general term that covers violations such as billing for fraudulent services, phantom patients, overbilling, faked accidents or injuries, using another person's insurance, and falsifying claims. We can defend you against charges involving all types of insurance, including:

* Auto insurance/personal injury protection (PIP)

* Homeowners' insurance

* Life insurance

* Social Security Disability insurance

* Health insurance

* Medicaid and Medicare

In Florida, staged car accidents and the use of fraudulent auto accident clinics has become a target of law enforcement. If you have been charged with involvement in a staged auto accident, you need a lawyer on your side immediately. You can count on the state to aggressively pursue these cases.

Because we are former state prosecutors, we understand how these types of cases will be prosecuted. We will build a defense strategy that counteracts the prosecution's case.
