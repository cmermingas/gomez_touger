## The Penalties Are Severe

The RICO Act prohibits a criminal organization from profiting from legitimate business operations. Penalties for a federal RICO conviction will vary based on the charge, but can include up to life in prison as well as property forfeiture for any assets obtained as a result of criminal activity. In Florida RICO cases, penalties may include fines up to three times the value gained by the offender or lost by the victim, whichever is greater.

RICO cases can be complex because these violations are typically charged in conjunction with other crimes. Your lawyer must have experience managing large cases and fighting criminal charges such as:

* [Insurance fraud]({% tl criminal.insurance_fraud %})

* Securities fraud

* Gambling
