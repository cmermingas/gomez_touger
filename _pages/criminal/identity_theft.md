## We Find Out What Really Happened

We thoroughly investigate charges to establish the facts. We understand that white collar crime charges are sometimes the result of an unintentional error. In some cases, law enforcement misinterprets an innocent financial mistake as a criminal act. Our experienced lawyers will protect your rights in cases involving issues such as:

* Filing false tax returns

* Forging a signature

* Stealing Social Security numbers

* Using another person's name to get a birth certificate, Social Security card, passport or a driver's license

* Credit card fraud

If you are also charged with forgery, counterfeiting, or mail or wire fraud, you may be charged with federal crimes. We can defend you in state and federal court.

Identity theft is a felony in Florida. Convictions may include fines, prison sentences and forfeiture of any personal property used to commit the offense. In addition, you may have to make restitution to the victims.
