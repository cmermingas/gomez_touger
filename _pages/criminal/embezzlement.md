Being charged with embezzlement can be frightening, especially if you are charged with stealing from your employer.

## Was There Intent To Defraud?

To convict a person of embezzlement, the prosecution must prove that the theft/fraud was intentional. In some cases, the person charged with embezzlement made a mistake or planned on returning the money in the future. Others may have believed they had a right to possess the property or were given consent by the owner to possess it. We understand that you may not have considered your actions to be criminal. Depending on the specifics of the case, there are defenses to embezzlement charges.

Embezzlement involves the theft of money or property by a person with a fiduciary relationship to the victim. Types of embezzlement may include:

* Theft from an employer

* Theft from an institution or organization

* Theft from a client

* Theft from a spouse or family member

In general, charges and penalties for embezzlement and theft are based on the amount/value of stolen money or property. Typically, if the value is $300 or more, you can be charged with a felony. If you have prior theft convictions, you may face higher charges and penalties.
