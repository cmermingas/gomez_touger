## We Exploit Weaknesses In The Prosecution's Case

As former prosecutors, we know what is necessary to convict someone of Internet sex crimes involving minors. The prosecution must be able to prove intent. Did the individual intend to meet with the minor or were they just role playing online? Did the adult have knowledge of the minor's age? We will investigate these issues and argue your side of the story.

We also investigate police procedure. Entrapment is fairly common in Internet sex cases. We will protect your constitutional rights if you were subject to improper law enforcement conduct.

Internet sex crimes can involve issues such as:

* Possession of child pornography

* Texting or sexting

* Videos or images on a smartphone

* Enticing/importuning/contacting a minor online

* Online chat rooms

We can defend you against Internet sex crime charges at the state and federal levels.

As with any sex offense, an Internet sex crime conviction can ruin your reputation, even if the charges are dropped. If convicted, you may be required to register on state and national sex offender databases. You cannot afford to take this risk. The rest of your life could be drastically affected by something as simple as a misunderstanding or unfortunate click of the mouse.
