## Violations Of Probation Or House Arrest

A violation of your probation or house arrest/Community Control can lead to an arrest. You may be held in jail without bond until you get a hearing. At the hearing, the judge can sentence you to jail or prison for the length of your probation. The judge can also decide to send you to jail/prison to serve the sentence you would have received if you had been convicted of the initial criminal charge.

At probation revocation hearings, there is only a judge, not a jury. The standard of proof in these hearings is lower than it is in a criminal trial, which gives the prosecution an advantage. Without a defense lawyer to protect your rights and argue your case, you will have little chance of convincing the judge to be lenient.

Some of the most common reasons for probation violations include:

* Alcohol or drug test failure

* Failure to report to your probation officer

* Failure to complete court-ordered community service

* Failure to complete court-ordered rehabilitation or education

* Failure to pay fines or court costs

You will also be in violation of your probation if you commit a new crime.
