# Tampa Drug Possession Lawyers

The severity of drug crime penalties has been debated for years. Many people, including some lawyers and judges, believe that these penalties are unnecessarily harsh and ultimately do more harm than good. While a few changes have been made, the majority of our country's drug crime penalties are still very severe.

The attorneys at {{ site.data.business.name }}, aggressively fight state and federal drug crime charges in Florida. As former state prosecutors, we understand how serious drug cases are and how vigorously the government prosecutes offenders. We will protect your rights at every step, starting with the legality of the search of your person, vehicle and home.

## We Protect Your Constitutional Rights

We can defend you against possession and [trafficking]({% tl criminal.drug_trafficking%}) charges involving marijuana, crack, cocaine, meth and prescription drugs such as OxyContin, oxycodone, hydrocodone, Vicodin and MDMA/Ecstasy. There is a surprisingly small difference between the amount of drugs for which you can be charged with possession or trafficking. We can represent you in either case.

Our aggressive approach to drug crimes defense includes ensuring that your constitutional rights were not violated by law enforcement. We examine the evidence and police procedure. If the police did not have probable cause to stop you or search you, we can argue that there was illegal search and seizure. By filing motions to suppress evidence gathered during an illegal search, we strive to keep evidence out of the prosecution's case. Many times, this means we can also file a motion to dismiss the charges.

If a dismissal is not possible, we will work hard to reduce the charges and/or minimize any penalties. If it is a first offense, drug court or other diversionary programs may be available.
